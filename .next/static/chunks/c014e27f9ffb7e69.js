Mastering these is necessary for writing English fluently. A good knowledge of grammar also improves your reading and listening skills. It is true that absolute grammatical accuracy is not essential for speaking fluently. However, a good knowledge of grammatical structures can definitely increase your self-confidence. When we do not know the grammar rules, we may think we are making too many mistakes, and we can lose our confidence to speak English in front of others. On the contrary, when we know the rules, we are able to recognise and correct our mistakes, and this is a great boost to our self-confidence."},{"heading":"Conversation","color":"#4169E1","paragraph":"In conversation lessons, you focus on expanding your range of vocabulary and expressions in a variety of everyday contexts.
